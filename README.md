# ⚔️ Console RPG: Java OOP Study Project

A simple, command-line, turn-based RPG designed for studying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java.

---

## 🎯 Project Focus

The purpose of this project is to implement and reinforce core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles using Java. It serves as a practical exercise focused on:

- **Classes and Objects:** Defining and managing relationships between entities (e.g., `Character`, `Monster`, `Ability`).
- **Encapsulation:** Organizing data and behavior for clearer component structure.
- **Basic Inheritance & Polymorphism (Optional):** Expanding gameplay through differentiated classes or monsters.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Character Creation:** Enter a name and define initial stats.
- **Class Selection:** Choose a starting class, each with two unique abilities.
- **Turn-Based Combat:** Battle randomly generated monsters in the terminal.
- **Console-Based Interface:** Fully text-based; runs via standard input/output.
